Performs file operations (moving, copying and archiving) on files/directories based on their access/change/modified dates.

## Description
This program provides moving, copying and archiving capabilities for files/directories based on their access time, change time or modified time.

The CLI interface contains nested sub-parsers where you'll be required to choose the time predicate and operation. This program also contains an API (see examples below) for usage in other Python programs, though its recommended to use the CLI, as that is how the program is designed to be used.


Both the copying and moving functionality utilize Python's `shutil` module, whereas the `tarfile` module is used for creating tar archives.

Python 3.7+ is required. 

## Installation
Using pipx (recommended):
```sh
pipx install timefops
```
Using pip:
```sh
pip3 install --user timefops
```
## Usage
Choosing the time predicate:

```
stiftcast@debian:~$ timefops -h
usage: timefops [-h] [-V] <time> ...

Operate on files/directories based on their access/change/modified dates.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -V, --version  print version number/info and exit

Time predicate:
  <time>
    atime        Perform operations based on last access-time.
    ctime        Perform operations based on last change-time.
    mtime        Perform operations based on last modification-time.
```
Choosing the operation:
```
stiftcast@debian:~$ timefops mtime -h
usage: timefops mtime [-h] [-V] <operation> ...

Perform operations based on last modification-time.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -V, --version  print version number/info and exit

Operations:
  <operation>
    archive      Archive contents to a tarball, with optional compression.
    copy         Copy contents to a different location.
    move         Move contents to a different (local) location.
```

<br /> Options for `archive`:
```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         print version number/info and exit

General arguments:
  src                   Source directories/files.
  -a ARCHIVE, --archive ARCHIVE
                        Name for target archive.
  -c {bz2,gz,xz}, --compression {bz2,gz,xz}
                        Compression format for the archive.
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                        Set folder name format (using Python's datetime
                        formatting directives).
  -i, --individual-items
                        Setting this flag will allow for specifying individual
                        source files and folders. The difference between
                        specifiying a source folder with this flag on is that
                        any folder(s) specified will not be traversed and
                        instead be treated as a standalone item.
  --dry-run             Show results, but don't execute.
```

Options for `copy` or `move`:
```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         print version number/info and exit

General arguments:
  src                   Source directories/files.
  -t TARGET_DIRECTORY, --target-directory TARGET_DIRECTORY
                        Destination directory.
  -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
                        Set folder name format (using Python's datetime
                        formatting directives).
  -i, --individual-items
                        Setting this flag will allow for specifying individual
                        source files and folders. The difference between
                        specifiying a source folder with this flag on is that
                        any folder(s) specified will not be traversed and
                        instead be treated as a standalone item.
  --dry-run             Show results, but don't execute.
```
## Examples

### API
```python
import timefops

# For archiving:
timefops.archive([list_of_dirs], dest_dir, "atime", "%Y-%m-%d", cmp="gz", individual=False, dry_run=False)

# For copying:
timefops.copy([list_of_dirs], dest_dir, "ctime", "%Y-%m-%d", individual=False, dry_run=False)

# For moving:
timefops.move([list_of_dirs], dest_dir, "mtime", "%Y-%m-%d", individual=False, dry_run=False)

# NOTE: if individual=True, then the iterable [list_of_dirs] can also contain paths to files.
```
### CLI
The provided commands can either be used on their own, or with the `find` and `xargs` commands in tandem. The latter is the recommended method, due to find's powerful filtering options.<br />

#### Standalone
Traverse through multiple directories and copy the contents somewhere, sorted by access-time:
```sh
timefops atime copy dir1/ dir2/ dir3/ -t /dest/path
```
Archive all the files and folders specified as is into a .tar.bz2 archive, sorted by modified-time:
```sh
timefops mtime archive file1 dir1/ dir2/ file2 -i -a standalone_example -c bz2
```
#### <br />Using `find` and `xargs` 
Find files accessed within the last hour and move them somewhere into folders with the 12-hour time, sorted by accessed-time:
```sh
find ./ -type f -amin -60 -print0 | xargs -0 timefops atime move -f "%I:%M%p" -i -t /dest/path
```
Find all shell scripts and put them in a gzip-compressed tar archive, sorted by changed-time:
```sh
find ./ -type f -iname "*.sh" -print0 | xargs -0 timefops ctime archive -i -a ex_archive -c gz
```
Get directories that were modified between April 1, 2020 - April 30, 2020 and copy them somewhere, sorted by modified-time:
```sh
find ./ -type d -newermt 2020-04-01 ! -newermt 2020-04-30 -prune -print0 | \
xargs -0 timefops mtime copy -i -t /dest/path
```
Specify directories to be traversed (-i flag is omitted) and copy the contents inside to somewhere, sorted by modified-time:
```sh
find ./ -type d \( -iname 'pat1' -o -iname 'pat2' \) -prune -print0 | \
xargs -0 timefops mtime copy -t /dest/path
```
